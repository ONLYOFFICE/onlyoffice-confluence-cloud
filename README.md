# ONLYOFFICE integration app for Confluence Cloud

This integration app enables users to edit office documents in [Confluence Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/premium) using ONLYOFFICE Docs.

## Features

The app allows to:

* View and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
* Co-edit documents in real-time using two co-editing modes (Fast and Strict), Track Changes, comments, built-in chat.

## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

To be able to edit documents in Confluence Cloud, you will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server). You can install free Community version or scalable Enterprise Edition.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.  

To install Enterprise Edition, follow the instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-enterprise-index.aspx).

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

## Configuring the integration app

Administrators can configure ONLYOFFICE integration app via the Manage Apps section in Confluence Cloud (Apps -> Manage Apps -> Confluence cloud ONLYOFFICE integration app -> Configure). On the configuration page, set up:

* **Document Editing Service Address**: The URL of the installed ONLYOFFICE Document Server.

* **Secret key**: Enables JWT to protect your documents from unauthorized access (further information can be found [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/signature/)).

* **JWT Header**.

## Using ONLYOFFICE integration app for Confluence Cloud

In the Pages module, you can attach files to the created pages: open the right context menu, click on the Attachments item and upload a file from the device. 

The uploaded file will appear in the Attachments list. To launch the editor, click **Edit in ONLYOFFICE**. The file opens in the same window. The changes made are saved in the same file.

If you try to open a file that is not supported by ONLYOFFICE Docs (for example, jpg), an error window will appear.
